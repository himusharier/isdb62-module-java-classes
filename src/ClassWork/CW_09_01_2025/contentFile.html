        <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
        <p>My journey into web development started when I was looking for a way to express my creativity online.

        <h2>Learning JavaScript</h2>
        <p>After mastering HTML and CSS, I moved on to JavaScript. This is where things got interesting! JavaScript enabled me to make websites interactive by allowing me to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). The more I learned, the more I realized the vast potential of web development.</p>
