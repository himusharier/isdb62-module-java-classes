1. Task Management System

Problem:
========>>
>>Design a task management application with the following features:
    1. A Task class with properties: id, title, description, status (e.g., Pending,
       In Progress, Completed), and dueDate.
    2. A TaskManager class that can:
        a. Add new tasks.
        b. Update task status.
        c. List tasks grouped by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
        d. Show overdue tasks (tasks with a dueDate in the past).
    3. Use List, Map, or Set where appropriate.
    4. Handle invalid inputs using try-catch.
    5. Ensure null safety in properties and methods.
