    I followed the steps below to get the Pair Extraordinaire Badge:
    1. Download the Github Desktop application and install it. https://desktop.github.com/
    2. Clone one of your repositories using GH Desktop app
    3. Create a branch
    4. IMPORTANT: Make sure you have added a Collaborator to the repo via github.com settings collaborator menu
    5. Make changes to your code
    6. Before you commit the changes using the GH Desktop app add a Co-Author, this can be found just above the Commit button
    7. Publish the changes
    8. Create a pull request
    9. Merge to default branch using squash and merge
    Hope that helps someone.
